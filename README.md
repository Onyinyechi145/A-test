# Introduction
## My tech journey
Been in the tech space has been a long time desire but for some weird reasons I have been unable to study due to circumstances that are not worth preventing me from doing so may be one was worth it. Bear in mind that I had lost opportunities like **scholarships** (Womentechsterfellowship) and had almost lost this recent one but when it is time, it is time.  I guess this is the right time for me to learn.
